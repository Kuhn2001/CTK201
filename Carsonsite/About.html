		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p> Hello There, my name is Carson Kuhn and I am a Creative Technology student at Illinois State University. I am going into my sophomore year of college. My focus of my major is video game design and I am very excided to add some of those projects I get from there onto this website. But a little about me I am 19 years old born on September 20, 2001 in Lake forest Illinois. I live in wildwood IL with my mom and dad. I love to play video games but when I’m not doing that I am doing school work, riding my bike or play some hockey. </p>

			<h2>What Inspired Me</h2>
			<p> I didn’t really get into video game until later in my life. I guess I was always outside when I was younger but I did play video like with my friend whenever they came over and I also played my Wii too but that was pretty much it. Until I got my second Xbox 360 its my second one because I had the first white one that came out in 2005 but I trade it in for a PSP so, I was a not so bright kid. But that second Xbox 360 flip a switch in my head in 2012 and ever since I’ve been hook. It really started in 2014 when I started to by most of the AAA games of that year and in 2015 going to my first midnight release of a game and the game was Batman Arkham Knight and I will always remember that night. </p>
